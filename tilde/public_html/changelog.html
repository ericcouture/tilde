    - completely reworked homepage: added some links, rearranged elements, removed animation from ascii art (i love css animations but it felt like it was just <i>too</i> much). i've actually had this written for a while but never got the chance to upload it. it's here now!<br>
    - rearranged all nav bar links, started consolidating extra non-main pages into a more organized site index page found at <a href="directory.html">"site index"</a>.<br>
            - added a changelog, (you're here! woo!)<br>
            - tried to standardize my webpage template, there's 100% an easier way to do this than what i'm doing, but fuck it, we ball. i don't care. i have a template in webstorm now. who knows if that's what i <i>should</i> be doing but whatever.
